# Sequencelib

A collection of formalizations of sequences from [The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS)](https://oeis.org).

The [main site](https://provables.github.io/sequencelib) contains an automatically generated index of the sequences formalized in this repository.
You can also find more detailed instructions for developing, building, and contributing.

## Quickstart

Start a development environment with `nix develop`.

Run `task -a` to see all the tasks available. The common ones are:

* `task build`: builds the project and checks the theorems.
* `task serve-page`: build the site and serve it locally.
